    <h1>Adding a Data Template to a Form</h1>
    <p><br></p><p> </p><ol><li>First identify the Form that you wish to create a template for.<br>If you don’t already have a Form, you can quickly create the Form using the Form Screen designer.<br><br></li><li>Next you’ll need a new or existing Word or Excel file.  <br>If you already have Word/Excel files that you have been printing to use as data capture Forms, these can easily be reused as a template.<br><br></li><li>Go through your template and insert <strong><i>placeholders</i></strong> wherever you want the system to inject answers from data entries of your chosen Form.<br>Placeholders are entered using the unique data name of the Form field, wrapped in curly braces – e.g. <strong>{{dataname}}</strong><br><br>So for example if your Form has a field with data name of “LastName”, then you can instruct the system to inject the answer for this field wherever the placeholder {{LastName}} appears.<br><br>Any formatting (font, color, highlighting, size etc) that you apply to the placeholder will be honoured by the system and applied to the answer value inserted.<br><br><strong>Important Note:<br>You may only have ONE placeholder or formula per cell.  Any other text in the cell will be discarded!</strong><br><br></li><li>Once you have inserted all the placeholders needed, upload the template file to your Form screen.<br>There are two places where you can add a template to a Form:<ol><li>Form Level<br><p>If you add a template at this level, you are instructing the system to use this template as the default whenever a PDF is generated.</p><p>Upload your template using the "Excel Template" field found in your Form's Settings page.</p><p><br></p></li><li>Connector Level</li><li>This is a template that is specific to one or more Connectors, but should not be used as a default.<br>Upload your template using the "add data template" link found on appropriate Connectors in your Form's Connectors page.</li></ol></li></ol><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>NOTE: Uploading a template also makes new export options available on the Data area.</p><p> </p><p><strong><span>Multiple Sheets</span></strong></p><p><br></p><p>The template engine supports multiples sheets in one Excel document. When outputting to a PDF, each sheet will start on a new page.</p><p> </p><p><strong><span>Testing Your Templates</span></strong></p><p> </p><p>Assuming you have at least one existing Form entry for your Form, you can test your templates fairly easily by using the Data area.</p><p><br></p><p>In the Data page, search entries against your Form and the version onto which you uploaded your template.</p><p>Once you have some Data results, hover over a row and click the Export option to get an instant look at your template output :)</p><p><br></p>
