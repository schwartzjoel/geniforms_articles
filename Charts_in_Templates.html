    <h1>Charts in Templates</h1>
    <div dir="ltr">
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">Charts in Excel or Word are <strong>not officially supported</strong> in our data template functionality.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;"><br></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">We are aware of some customers having success generating basic charts within their data templates, however this is very much on a case by case basis.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">If you have issues trying to generate charts in your templates, we will NOT provide you with any assistance.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;"><br></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">Please also realise that even if charts may work currently for your specific case, your templates are not guaranteed to continue working into the future.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">Should a chart stop working, again we will NOT offer any assistance.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;"><br></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">Given the lack of official support, we recommend against trying to use charts in your Excel/Word data templates.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;"><br></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">In terms of generating charts more consistently, one option is to use our Google Spreadsheets connector to populate a Sheet, and then create a separate Sheet with charts that runs off of the connector-generated Sheet.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;"><br></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">You can also consider dashboard and reporting tools such as Klipfolio and Zoho Reports - often the easiest way to drive these tools is to use a Google Sheet as the data source for the charts.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;"><br></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">Finally, if you run Sql Server Reporting Services or other similar business intelligence tools, you can consider using our Sync product.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">Sync effectively replicates Form data into a local SQL database running on your servers.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">This allows you to create and run reports locally using your tools of choice.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.9px;">Talk to our Customer Success team if you'd like to know more about our Sync offering.</p>
