    <p style="">Yes, this is possible via our App Printing feature :)<br>Search for "App Printing" in our help documentation to find an article with full details of how to build your desired output.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Our App Printing functionality make use of standard operating system print services to deliver the generated output to the connected printer.</p><ul><li style="">For Android, we use Android Print Services, which have been available since Android 4.4.</li><li style="">On iOS, we use the AirPrint standard from Apple</li><li style="">On Windows, we use Windows standard Printer dialog and processing</li></ul><p><br></p><p style="">So provided your chosen printer supports the above standards, it should be available for printing use.</p><p style=""><br></p><p style="">If your printer does not support these standards, then they likely have their own specific implementation.</p><p style="">If this is the case then we can't do much to help since our focus is on supporting established standards, not manufacturer specific requirements.</p><p><br></p><p style="">You should check into whether the manufacturer provides a standard printer driver which hooks into the operating system provided print features, such that the relevant print manager shows your printer as a valid printing destination.<br>For example, Zebra provides apps named "Zebra Print Station" and "Zebra Utilities" which may provide the necessary bridge/driver to expose the Zebra printer in operating system printer dialogs.</p><p style=""><br></p><p style="">Alternatively you should consider using "cloud print" options to generate printing jobs via Form connectors.  This way the PDF generated on the platform was emailed to a cloud print address, which in turn resulted in the linked printer printing the PDF.</p><p style=""><br></p><p style=""><br></p>
