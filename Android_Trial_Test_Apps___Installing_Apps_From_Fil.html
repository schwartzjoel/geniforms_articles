    <h1>Android Trial/Test Apps - Installing Apps From File</h1>
    <p>We generally provide trial and test versions of your branded app via a direct download of the Android APK file.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To install on this your Android devices:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1. Download the attached zip file and unzip on your computer.  You will then have an APK file.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2. Copy the APK file to your Android device.  </p>
<p>This is usually done using a USB cable and whatever software your particular device model came with.  It's the same process as you would use to copy music or pictures.</p>
<p>Make a note of the device folder you copy the APK file to.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3. On your Android device, use a file explorer app such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">ES File Explorer</a> to browse your device's files.</p>
<p>Using your file explorer app, go to the folder containing your APK and tap it to install.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>NOTE: Some Android devices don't allow the installation of apps from what Google refers to as "unknown sources." <br>Fortunately, it's usually very easy to enable this functionality.</p>
<p>Simply pop over to your phone's Settings menu (usually found by hitting the menu button from the home screen) and tap the option for Applications.</p>
<p>You should see an option that says "Unknown sources." <br>Fill the check box next to it, then click OK on the resulting popup alert.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4. Once the app is installed, you can log in using any existing Tap-to or Your Company account that you may have.</p>
<p><br></p>
