    <h1>Creating a Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>A web-hosted privacy policy page is required as part of the branded app publishing process, as well as by several integrations when you setup a branded website (i.e. Website as a Service).</p><p><br></p><p>If you don't already have a Privacy Policy, you will need to create one and host this on your website as a permanent link.<br>You can generate a privacy policy document quite easily thanks to policy generator tools - just do a Google search for "privacy policy generator".Â </p><p><br></p><p>Here's one such site that generates a reasonably standard privacy policy:<br><br><a href="https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/" target="_blank">https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com</a><br><br>Once you have appropriate privacy policy words generated, add this as a web page to your standard company website.</p><p><br>The result should be that your policy can be accessed via a website link - e.g. <a href="http://www.mycompany.com/privacy-policy" rel="noreferrer">www.mycompany.com/privacy-policy</a>.<br>Make a note of this link and use it when prompted in your branded app/website process.</p><p><br></p><p>If you're not sure about how to add a Privacy Policy page to your company website, then ask the IT person/provider that maintains your website for help.</p><p><br></p><p>Please note that your Privacy Policy may have legal implications for your business.<br>If in doubt, consult your legal advisors to ensure that your policy document meets your needs.</p><p><br></p>
