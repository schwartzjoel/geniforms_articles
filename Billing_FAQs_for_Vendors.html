    <h1>Billing FAQs for Vendors</h1>
    <div rel="clipboard_data">
<p>Below are some commonly asked questions by Vendor customers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I see pricing for the various add-on options?</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Pricing calculations are all built into the Billing page :)<br>In the Billing page, if you hit the "Buy" button next to any add-on option then you'll be able to see the monthly and annual fees payable.<br>The Buy action is only applied when you hit the Save button - and there is a Confirm step thereafter - so there is no risk of immediate purchase when you hit the Buy button.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the purpose of the user purchase option in the Billing area?  Why does it only give "Annually" as an option?</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The option to purchase annual users as a Vendor is specifically so that you can take advantage of prepaid annual discounts.On old grandfathered plans, paying for users annually was never an option - with our new model, now it is :)</p>
<p>NOTE: If you prepay for annual users on a client, <strong>they can still exceed that annual license count </strong>- any additional activated users above the prepaid number will simply be billed at monthly rates in arrears as normal.</p>
<p>This is handy if you have a known, fixed number of annual users but need to allow for additional users as needed.</p>
<p>See the question below for details of how to enforce user/device limits.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I limit the number of users or devices that a client can add to their account?</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you want to specifically limit the maximum number of users, you can do so via:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Company API, or</li>
<li>Via the Organisation Setup page - when logged in as a Vendor Admin, you'll see various user limit options on the right hand side.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I activate a trial of an add-on for a client?</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You do this via the Billing page; the process is the same for every add-on.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Billing page, and select the client from the "Show Prepaid Billing For" dropdown</li>
<li>After the page refreshes, hit the Try button next to the Enterprise Toolkit add-on</li>
<li>You will see instructions on what to do next in the activation page</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Thereafter</em><em> for Enterprise Toolkit:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Log into the client account by going to the Clients page and switching context into the client</li>
<li>Grant the Enterprise Admin user level to the desired target users.<br>Those users will then see the new Environments and Repository options in the Menu.</li>
<li>Notify your client as desired of the add-on availability.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Thereafter</em><em> for</em><em> Sync:</em></p>
<p>You'll need to download the Sync install and provide this, along with the Sync license key, to your client for them to install.</p>
<p>You may also want to adjust the colour scheme of the Sync install, which is easily done by changing the css file within the install zip.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Thereafter</em><em> for</em><em> App as a Service:</em></p>
<p>Gather the required elements as outlined in the activation page, and provide those to us for building of the trial apps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I upload my own customisations to the Sync installation file?</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Currently there is no option to inject your own branded artefacts into the Sync zip file.<br>Sync is a standard download though, so you can download it once and distribute to clients as needed.<br>You'll only need to update the Sync zip when we release new Sync versions, which will be announced via blog and email.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Note:</em> You'll still need to activate a trial or purchase Sync per client in order to get a license key for each client.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Q: If I activate a trial of an add-on, e.g. Sync, from the Billing area, how does my client get notified?</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We don't send anything to your client when you activate a trial of Sync or any other add-on for a client account.</p>
<p>The expectation is that you, as the Vendor, will download the Sync package and provide it, along with the Sync key, to your client as desired.</p>
<p>You may also want to adjust the colour scheme of the Sync install, which is easily done by changing the css file within the install zip.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For other add-ons the experience is similar - i.e. nothing is sent to the client by us, we expect you as the Vendor to be the intermediary.  </p>
<p>In the case of the Enterprise Toolkit, activation will immediately expose the Environments and Repository options in the platform's Menu.  <br>This will be visible to Enterprise Admin users of the target client - so they may notice that :)</p>
