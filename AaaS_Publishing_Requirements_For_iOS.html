The email address does not need to be linked to a developer account at this stage or an Apple ID. It's only once the user wants to get their branded iOS app in the Apple App store, that they will need an Apple ID and a Developer Account with Apple. Details for this are below.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">iOS Developer Account</span></strong></p><p dir="ltr">For us to publish your branded app under your company brand in the Apple App Store, you will need to sign up for an Organisational iOS Developer Account. &nbsp;</p><p>Apple Developer Accounts cost USD 99 per year. &nbsp;</p><p>It is your responsibility to pay for and maintain your Developer Account subscription.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">Please see this<a href="http://support.Your Company.com/solution/articles/Google%20charges%20a%20one-time%20%2425%20fee%20to%20get%20a%20developer%20account%20on%20Google%20Play,%20which%20lets%20you%20publish%20Android%20apps.%20%20It%20is%20your%20responsibility%20to%20pay%20for%20and%20maintain%20your%20Developer%20Account%20subscription." style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><a dir="ltr" href="http://support.Your Company.com/support/solutions/articles/11000010761" target="_blank">article on how to create an iOS developer account with Apple.</a></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Privacy Policy</span></strong></p><p dir="ltr">As part of this process, you will also need to provide a link to your company's Privacy Policy.<br>This must be hosted as a page on your company's website.</p><p dir="ltr"><br>If you don't already have a Privacy Policy page, then you can generate a privacy policy document quite easily - just do a web search for "privacy policy generator".
