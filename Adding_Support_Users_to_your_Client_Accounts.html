    <h1>Adding Support Users to your Client Accounts</h1>
    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1.4em; line-height: 19.59375px;">When setting up, testing and supporting your clients, you will usually need a user login to run the app under that specific client's account.<br>This is needed so you can test the Screens you've built and provide support to your clients when they have issues.</p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1.4em; line-height: 19.59375px;"><strong>To meet this need, your team can create "support users" in your client accounts, free of charge.</strong><br>"Support users" are strictly for testing and support purposes - these accounts cannot be used as a production user by your client.<br>We have a "soft limit" policy of 1 free support user per client - so you can have more support users in a client account when necessary - but please note that we actively monitor for abuse of this facility.</p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 1.4em; margin-bottom: 1.4em;"><span style="line-height: 19.5938px;">Creating a support user is easy - simply ensure you are logged into your client's account context and navigate to Organization &amp; Users -&gt; Users &amp; Groups.</span><img class="fr-dib fr-bordered fr-fil" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/11039081481/original/h55x9DHKDKQOSOe1hYewMeP8E912l8ZW5g.png?1544499759" style="width: 147px; height: 260.148px;" data-filelink="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/11039081481/original/h55x9DHKDKQOSOe1hYewMeP8E912l8ZW5g.png?1544499759" data-fileid="11039081481" data-uniquekey="1544499719277"></p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 1.4em; margin-bottom: 1.4em;"><span style="line-height: 19.5938px;"><br>Then hit the "Add User" button to create a new user in your client's account.<br></span><span style="line-height: 19.5938px;">Support users are identified by our billing system as having the same email address as a team member registered in your master account.<br></span><strong>So you MUST ensure that your support users are created with an email address that matches a master account user's email exactly.</strong><br>Failure to use a matching master email address will result in your support user being picked up for billing by our system.</p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 1.4em; margin-bottom: 1.4em; line-height: 19.59375px;">Our platform automatically creates a support user whenever you create a new client account.<br>The email address of the support user created is copied from the currently logged in master account user that creates the client.</p><h2 style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 1.4em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Notes</span></h2><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 1.4em; margin-bottom: 1.4em; line-height: 19.5938px;"><br></p><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1em;">We recommend you seek to have a single support user account in your client accounts, using a generic email address rather than a personal email.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1em;">i.e. create your support users with email of "support@yourcompany.com" rather than "john@yourcompany.com"</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1em;">While not required, we recommend that you set different passwords on each support user you create.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1em;">This is because the app </span><span style="line-height: 13px;">distinguishes</span><span style="line-height: 1em;"> existing users already installed on the device via their password by default.</span><span style="line-height: 13px;"><br></span><span>Consider using a standard support user password approach which differs say by the client's name - clientABC vs clientXYZ</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1em;">Every new support user that you create is an independent user in it's own right.  <br></span><span style="line-height: 1em;">There is no link or synchronisation between the test/support users and the team member's master user account.</span><br><br><br><br></li></ul>
